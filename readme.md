# Legit Password Generator

## About the Project
This project is designed to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. I developed this application during the second week of Full-Stack Software Development at Columbia University. Publication date 10/1/2020 <br />

Password criteria:
- Between 8 and 128 characters
- The user will have options to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols
